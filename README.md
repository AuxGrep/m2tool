# About
Anti-Malware (formerly M2tool) is a Python-based application designed to detect and remove malicious files from a system. Initially developed as M2tool, the project has evolved into a more advanced anti-malware solution following several enhancements and added features.
The tool scans files and directories for malware using the VT API, with a focus on identifying suspicious  .dll, .exe, etc payloads. It offers real-time monitoring, heuristic analysis, and automated email reporting with comprehensive information to keep administrators informed of detected threats.
